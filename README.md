# Quiz Test Program

This is a simple Python quiz program I created to practice basic programming concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, lists, and user input.  
The program asks a few personal quiz questions and gives feedback based on your answers.

## Features

- Asks multiple-choice questions one by one  
- Accepts user input for each question  
- Checks answers and gives instant feedback (Correct / Incorrect)  
- Displays correct answers at the end  
- Shows your final score as a percentage

## How It Works

1. Each question has four options (A, B, C, D).  
2. The user types a letter (Aâ€“D) as their answer.  
3. The program compares the input to the correct answer and keeps track of the score.  
4. When all questions are answered, the final results are displayed.
